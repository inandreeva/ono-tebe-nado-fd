                Not just dropped out, but left after the first lecture. What
                would your bid be if you didn't know the director was Paul
                Thomas Anderson?
              </p>
              <p>
                Paul Thomas Anderson's "Hard Eight" (1996) was his feature
                debut, made after he left film school early. The film went on to
                establish him as one of the most talented directors of his
                generation. Who would have thought that someone who walked out
                on their first lecture would create such compelling cinema?

                Almost a thousand pages long. Sometimes without punctuation and
                with transitions to Old English. It simultaneously tells the
                story of June 16, 1904, and the history of literature from
                ancient times. And all of this is layered on top of Homer's epic
                poem. How much would you bid on James Joyce's "Ulysses"?
              </p>
              <p>
                "Ulysses" by James Joyce is considered one of the most important
                works of modernist literature. Initially rejected by publishers
                and criticized for its complexity, it's now recognized as a
                masterpiece. The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique and
                experimental style revolutionized 20th-century literature.

                Really, there's a line here, a circle there, and here something
                that looks like a paramecium. No fields, no forests, no cats...
                How much would you bid on this if you didn't know it was one of
                Kandinsky's revolutionary works?
              </p>
              <p>
                Wassily Kandinsky's abstract paintings were groundbreaking when
                first created. Critics mocked them for their apparent simplicity,
                but Kandinsky's work laid the foundation for abstract art. His
                paintings are now considered among the most influential in the
                history of modern art, selling for millions at auctions.
